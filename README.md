# Heroku Documentation Website


## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š

Welcome to this front-end coding challenge.

This challenge will help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this heroku documentation website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.


Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

There are some icons like facebook, linkedin icons that are not available in the asset folder and you will have to go get them at `Font Awesome` website

**What is Fontawesome and how can you use it**

FontAwesome is a popular icon library that provides a wide range of icons and symbols that can be used in web applications. Here's a short documentation on how to bring in FontAwesome icons into your HTML:

1. First, go to the FontAwesome website (fontawesome.com) and sign up for an account. Once you're logged in, you can access the library of icons.

2. Next, you need to link to the FontAwesome CSS file in your HTML document. Add the following code in the head section of your HTML:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.15.3/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-QHOeK/6gTlpTsn+OGgdz08X9TCtbYuhKnfYmGv2HbQzz8Uksd6a+P6Uzkbm9LXZJ" crossorigin="anonymous">
Remember that the above code looks like whenever we want to link to a CSS file, just that this time around, it's FontAwesome's CSS file not ours

3. Once the CSS file is linked, you can add FontAwesome icons to your HTML document using the "i" tag and specifying the icon class you want to use. For example, to add a Facebook icon, you can use the following code:

<i class="fab fa-facebook"></i>

Here, "fab" stands for "FontAwesome Brands" (for icons from brand logos), and "fa-facebook" is the name of the Facebook icon.

4. You can customize the size, color, and other properties of the icons by adding classes to the "i" tag. For example, to make the Facebook icon larger, you can add the "fa-3x" class:

<i class="fab fa-facebook fa-3x"></i>

This will make the icon three times larger than the default size.

That's it! With these simple steps, you can add FontAwesome icons to your HTML document and enhance the visual appeal of your web applicationðŸš€ðŸš€.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Submitting your solution

To submit your solution, take the following steps:
1. create a repository on github and name it **heroku documentation website**
2. push your code to the repository
3. invite **aydotjs** as a collaborator



## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. I recommend:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)


**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
